# SpaceInitiative
A space combat initiative helper for the Starfinder Tabletop RPG

This is an ASP.NET Core 2.0 website that helps with the Piloting rolls required at the start of every round of space combat in Starfinder. 

I generally run this in an ASP.NET Core Docker container on a Linux server.
